# RAWS2012
This repository contains the codes for data analysis of voltage data from Ooty Radio Telescope and Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). This analysis was a part of Radio Astronomy Winter School, 2021 organised by National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), Pune and Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, India.

## Analysis of voltage data

### Pulsar signal 
This code analysis the voltage data of Vela pulsar from Ooty radio telescope. The integrated pulse profile of the Vela pulsar is obtained using the De-dispersed dynamic spectrum for north and south apertures. The obtained time period of the pulsar is 89 ms.

### identifying RFI channels
This code uses the power spectrum to identify RFI channels involtage data from Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).
